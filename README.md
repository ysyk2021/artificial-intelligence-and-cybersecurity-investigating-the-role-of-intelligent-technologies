As our world becomes increasingly connected through technology, the risk of cyber threats and attacks continues to rise. Cybersecurity is a critical concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike, and it is essential that we develop effective strategies for protecting against cyber threats. Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Investigating the Role of Intelligent Technologies in Protecting Against Cyber Threats is a comprehensive guide to the role of intelligent technologies in cybersecurity.

In this book, we will explore the ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) and other intelligent technologies are being used to protect against cyber threats. We will provide an overview of the current state of cybersecurity, including common threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the limitations of traditional cybersecurity approaches.

The first chapter will introduce the concept of AI and its potential applications in cybersecurity, as well as some of the challenges and ethical considerations associated with using intelligent technologies to protect against cyber threats. We will discuss how AI can be used to detect and prevent cyber attacks, as well as how it can be used to improve incident response and recovery.

Subsequent chapters will delve deeper into specific areas of cybersecurity where intelligent technologies are being applied, including threat detection, network security, data privacy, cloud security, and IoT security. We will explore the benefits and limitations of these technologies, as well as the skills and knowledge required to implement them effectively.

Throughout the book, we will draw on real-world examples of intelligent technologies in cybersecurity, as well as case studies of successful cybersecurity strategies and best practices. By understanding the ways in which AI and other intelligent technologies are being used in cybersecurity, we can develop effective strategies for protecting against cyber threats and safeguarding our digital assets.
